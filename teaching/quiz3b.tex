\begin{changemargin}{0pt}{137.4803pt} Find the real numbers within the interval $I$ at which $f$ is \emph{not} continuous. State whether $f$ is continuous from the right, the left, or neither. Justify with words and/or a graph of $y=f(x)$.
\begin{parts}
\part[1] $\displaystyle{f(x)=\frac{1}{x^2+4x-21}}$\hfill $I=(-\infty,\infty)$\vskip1.5mm
\part[1] $\displaystyle{f(x)=\frac{\sin{\frac{x}{2}}}{\cos{2x}}}$\hfill $I=[-\pi,\pi]$\vskip1.5mm
\part[1] $\displaystyle{f(x)=\begin{cases}2^x&x\leq 3\\-3x+17&3<x\leq 4\\\frac{1}{\sqrt{x-3}}&x>4
	\end{cases}}$\hfill $I=(-3,8)$

\question[3] Sketch a graph of a function $f(x)$ satisfying the following properties:\\
$\displaystyle\lim_{x\to-\infty}f(x)=-3$,~ $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to -1^+}f(x)=-1$,~ $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0}f(x)=-\infty$,~ $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to 2}f(x)=3$,~ $f(2)=4$,~ $\displaystyle\lim_{x\to \infty} f(x)=1$,~ $f$ has only two points of discontinuity in the real numbers.
